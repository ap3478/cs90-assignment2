def split_file(path: Path, root: Path) -> list[Chunk]:
    """Return one Chunk for every function and method in the Python file at `path`.

    Rules. The tests check every one.

    1. Make a chunk for each `def` or `async def` that sits directly in the module,
       and for each `def` or `async def` that sits directly in a class that sits
       directly in the module. Nothing else becomes a chunk: not code outside
       functions, not a class with no methods, not a function nested inside another
       function, not a class nested inside a class, and not a function defined inside
       an `if`, `try`, `for`, `while` or `with` block at module level.
    2. name is the function name, or "ClassName.method_name" for a method.
    3. start_line is the line of the `def`, or the line of the first decorator if the
       function has decorators. end_line is the last line of the function.
       Both count from 1.
    4. text is exactly the source lines start_line to end_line, joined with "\\n".
       Split the file's text on "\\n" (not with str.splitlines) so your line numbers
       agree with the ones ast reports.
    5. file is the path of `path` relative to `root`, written with forward slashes,
       e.g. "sessions.py" or "sub/module.py".
    6. Return the chunks in the order they appear in the file.

    Hint: ast.parse(source) gives you a tree. tree.body lists the top-level
    statements. A function node has .name, .lineno, .end_lineno and .decorator_list,
    and each decorator node has its own .lineno. A class node has .name and .body.
    Read the file with encoding="utf-8".
